DOCUMENTATION

Perlbal::Plugin::CacheKill - Deny caching on certain response codes

This plugin provides Perlbal the ability to deny caching on certain response codes. This plugin was made to sit between the application servers and squid. Squid 2.7 lacks the ACL ability to deny caching on response code, Perlbal::Plugin::CacheKill takes care of appending No-Cache headers on specific response codes.

Perlbal::Plugin::CacheKill documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc Perlbal::Plugin::CacheKill

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
